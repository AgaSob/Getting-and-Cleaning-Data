## Script consist of the following parts:

0. Download the data, unzip and read datasets
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
